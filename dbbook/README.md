Dbbook dataset

This dataset contains information about user preferences in the book field and some information about those books extracted from dbpedia. For this reason, this dataset is provided in 2 configurations:
1. user-item
2. user-item-prop

The first one provides only user tastes about books, while the second one adds descriptive info about books.

The file relation2id.tsv contains the mapping of relations of the dataset,
while entity2id.tsv contanins the mapping of the nodes (users, items, properites)
